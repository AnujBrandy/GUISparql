# GUISparql
A GUI Client to execute sparql queries
Basically we created a GUI Client which provides functions to execute sparql queries. SPARQL Queries are parsed and then analused for the type of Query that has been used.
There is one additional function that saves the data queried in different formats and one can visualise those data in the GUI Client or opt it to save in separate files.
The formats supported are JSON, turtle, etc.
